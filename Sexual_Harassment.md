* What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?
  Sexual harassment includes unsuitable behaviors such as inappropriate comments, jokes, or gestures, unwanted physical contact, sending explicit messages, or using a position of authority to intimidate. For example, repeated inappropriate
  remarks about appearance or unsolicited physical advances are common forms.
* What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?
  If I face or witness such behavior, I would address it directly if safe, document the incidents, and report them to respective committee or the designated authority. I would also seek support from colleagues or counselors and escalate
  legally if necessary action isnâ€™t taken
